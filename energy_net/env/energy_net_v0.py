Energy Net V0 Environment

A unified multi-agent environment that integrates both the ISO and PCS agents
into a single simulation. This environment follows the multi-agent extension
of the Gym interface, where step() takes multiple actions and returns multiple
observations, rewards, and done flags.

Key features:
1. Integrated controller for both ISO and PCS agents
2. Sequential processing of agent actions
3. Single timeline and shared state management
4. Direct access to comprehensive metrics

This environment serves as the main interface between RL algorithms and the
underlying energy net simulation, enabling the training of agents that can
efficiently manage electricity markets and battery storage.

    Multi-agent environment for simulating energy grid dynamics.
    
    This environment integrates both ISO and PCS agents into a single simulation,
    following a multi-agent extension of the Gym interface where step() takes multiple
    actions and returns observations, rewards, and done flags for all agents.
    
    The environment uses a unified controller to manage the sequential
    simulation, where:
    1. ISO agent sets energy prices
    2. PCS agent responds with battery control actions
    3. Energy exchanges occur
    4. State updates and rewards are calculated
    
    This approach eliminates the need for manual transfers between separate
    environments and provides a more realistic simulation with direct access
    to comprehensive metrics.
